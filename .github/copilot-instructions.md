# BME280 IoT Dashboard Project Instructions

This project is a professional IoT dashboard for monitoring BME280 sensor data from ESP32 devices.

## Project Structure
- Next.js web application with TypeScript
- Real-time data visualization with charts
- API endpoints to receive sensor data
- In-memory data storage for historical data
- Responsive design with modern UI

## Key Features
- Temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring
- Real-time charts and graphs with Recharts
- Historical data analysis
- Device status indicators
- Professional dashboard interface
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Use modern React hooks and patterns
- Prioritize performance and user experience

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/sensor-data - Receive data from ESP32
- GET /api/sensor-data - Fetch historical data with optional filters

## Technologies Used
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- date-fns for date formatting

## Current Status: âœ… COMPLETED - Project fully set up and running

The dashboard is now ready for use. ESP32 can send sensor data to the API endpoint and the dashboard will display real-time charts and statistics.
